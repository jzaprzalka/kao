# KAO

bar**K**ode **A**ttachment to **O**penfoodfacts in Vue. 

## Description

The application is made in order to facilitate gaining information about food products using their barcode in any shop all around the globe. It communicates with [OpenFoodFacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) API to get the most recent data. 

## Technologies

The application is a mobile app developed in [Quasar framework](https://quasar.dev/) for [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/). As far as the scope of this project is concerned, the app is intended for multi-platform mobile devices, but with minor customizations it can be made into a web platform. 

## Functionalities

With KAO mobile app the user is able to scan their product with the camera of his phone and gain interesting information about the product they scanned this for. An alternative to scanning the barcode with the camera is manual text input of the barcode numbers. 

In the product's details view one can scroll through various information about the object: from its producer and place of origin to the nutrition facts and comparison to other products in the category. 

The application, as the API, gives the user the possibility to change the country to search through products only within their country (and in that country's language for that matter).
